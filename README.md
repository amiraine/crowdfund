  * The ability to filter through projects based on certain project criteria such as funding remaining, if the project is a charity or a product prototype, etc.
  * The ability to 'fund' a project by clicking a button and filling out a payment form.
  * The ability to post the user's own project idea for funding.
  * As an administrator, the ability to add, update, or delete projects.
