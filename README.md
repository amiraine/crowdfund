#### By **Ami**

## Description
A reimagining of a crowdfunding site with the following features:
  * The ability to see a list of all projects/ideas/charities.
  * The ability to click on a project and see additional details about it.
  * The ability to filter through projects based on certain project criteria such as funding remaining, if the project is a charity or a product prototype, etc.
  * The ability to 'fund' a project by clicking a button and filling out a payment form.
  * The ability to post the user's own project idea for funding.
  * As an administrator, the ability to add, update, or delete projects.
  * each project has its own page.
  * Being able to select a category

## Dev notes

  * add pipe for fundraiser type (product or charity)
  * add pipe for other categories (animals, technology, some other stuff)
  * firebase
